# F1 — PID Control of a Mass–Spring–Damper System

**Project Status:** COMPLETE

This repository contains a technical project record documenting a self-directed embedded controls study.

The project explores discrete-time PID control applied to a canonical mass–spring–damper system, with focus on modeling assumptions, controller structure, actuator saturation, disturbance rejection, and measurement noise.

## Document Scope and Intent

This document is **not** a white paper, academic publication, or tutorial.

It is written as an **engineering note / technical project record**, intended to preserve reasoning, decisions, experiments, and observations developed throughout the project.

The focus is not on controller optimization or novel methods, but on understanding how classical control concepts translate from continuous-time models to discrete-time embedded execution under realistic non-idealities.

## Project Emphasis

The work emphasizes:

- traceability from continuous-time ODEs to discrete-time implementation
- consistency between simulation and embedded execution
- explicit treatment of actuator saturation, disturbances, and measurement noise
- deterministic control-loop structure suitable for embedded systems
- interpretation of observed behavior rather than performance optimization
